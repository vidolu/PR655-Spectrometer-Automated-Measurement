# Automated Spectral Measurement for the PR655 Spectrometer 
## Background
This code was developed to script spectral measurements from the PR655 Spectrometer over serial USB communication using a Raspberry Pi 4b. Each measurement observed a unique filter selected by a stepper motor and measured at 1440 positions.
